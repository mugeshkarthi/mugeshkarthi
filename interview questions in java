What is exception propagation in Java?

In Java, exception propagation is the process by which an exception that is thrown in a method 
is passed on to the calling method. When an exception occurs in a method, 
Java automatically creates an exception object and throws it to the method's caller.
The caller can then decide how to handle the exception.
